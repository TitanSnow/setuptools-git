* Git thinks that filenames are bytestreams, not character sequences.
  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/122860

* Git can not work across different encodings, and admits as much.
  Then again Subversion can't either.

* Our only hope is to ask Git for bytestreams and apply some heuristics
  as to the encoding and composition used.

* ATM, setuptools-git tries to locate files on the filesystem and returns
  only filenames it can find. I assume this is an attempt at normalization.

* We might get away with passing along the bytestreams in Python 2,
  but in Python 3 we must return Unicode.

* For passing through non-UTF-8 filenames under Python 3, use the
  'surrogateescape' error handler.
